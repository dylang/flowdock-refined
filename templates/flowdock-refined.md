A refined theme for the Flowdock desktop client.

## Chat Improvements

* Highlights what you wrote with a blue background.
* Larging padding between "breaks in time".
* Cleaner textarea for typing.
* Smaller Send and Upload buttons, both moved to the right.

## Flow Improvements

* Unifies a few different text styles and fonts used by the flow to one style.
* Easy to see see Github repo names.
* Removes redundant usernames.
* Removes unnecessary commit hashes.
* Removes unneeded times.
* Removes unnecessary #-tags caused by PR (closes #37 makes Flowdock create a #37 tag).
* For commits, quickly see files modified/added/removed.
* Dispalys real urls instead of the word "Original".

## Bonus
* Larger emoji, especially :shipit:.
* Round avatars, because why not.
* Provides an avatar for Jenkins.

## Inspiration

Inspired by my Opower co-worker [Nowell Strite](https://github.com/nowells) and
Shopify's [Flowdock Styles](https://github.com/Shopify/flowdock_styles).

## Installation

```bash
$ npm -g install flowdock-refined
```

That's all you need. If you already have custom styling for Flowdock it will back up your changes first.

## Future

I'm limited by what I can modify because we can't add Javascript to the page
with the desktop application. Please vote [to enable JavaScript plugins](http://flowdock.uservoice.com/forums/36827-general/suggestions/5519689-userscript-or-plugin-capability-in-desktop-client)
so we can make a lot more changes.

This is not a product of Flowdock.
